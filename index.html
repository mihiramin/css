        <li>What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</li>
        <p>The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 has been split into different sections, called modules. Each of these modules is making its way through the W3C in various stages of the recommendation process.</p>
        <li> Name a few CSS style components</li> 
        <p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components: Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. For example, font-size , width , background-color . Values: Each property is assigned a value.</p>
        <li>What do you understand by CSS opacity?
        </li>
        <p>The opacity property sets the opacity level for an element. The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 0 is completely transparent.</p>
        <li>How can the background color of an element be changed?</li>
        <p>The first and simplest way to change the background color is by using inline CSS, which appears in the HTML code itself. To use inline CSS, find the opening tag of the element you want to target, then add the attribute style=“background-color: yourcolorhere;”.</p>
        <li>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</li>
        <p>The background-repeat CSS property sets how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal and vertical axes, or not repeated at all</p>
        <li>What is the use of the background-position property?</li>
        <p>The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.</p>
        <li>Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</li>
        <p>One way you can achieve this is by using the flexbox CSS property.</p>
        <li>Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</li>
        <p>It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.</p>
        <li>How to center block elements using CSS1?
        </li>
        <p>To center a box within another box, first turn the containing box into a flex container by setting its display property to flex . Then set align-items to center for vertical centering (on the block axis) and justify-content to center for horizontal centering (on the inline axis).</p>
        <li>How to maintain the CSS specifications?
        </li>
        <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). </p>
        <li>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</li>
        <p>CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.</p>
        <li>What is embedded style sheets?</li>
        <p>: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. </p>
        <li>What are the external style sheets?</li>
        <p> a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. </p>
        <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</li>
        <p>Some of its primary advantages are increased website speed, time efficiency, flexibility, consistency, etc. Its disadvantages are limited security, cross-browser issues, extra work for developers, etc</p>
        <li>What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</li>
        <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</p>
        <li>What are the media types allowed by CSS?
        </li>
        <p>Media Types in CSS3	Description
            all	Default media types, used for all devices
            screen	Devices with screens, such as desktops, laptops, phones, and more
            print	Styles are applied when the document is printed
            speech	For devices used in speech synthesis and screen reading</p>
        <li>What is the rule set?</li>
        <p>A selector list and an associated declarations block, together, are called a ruleset, </p>
